        <p> Focused… Most of, not all, the students here are focused on their goals, whether it be Competitive Programming, GSOC, Research or just Grades.<br><br/>

            Unkempt… All engineering students are unorganized and shabby, a trend that is well preserved over here, especially by my wing-mates.<br><br/>
            
            Competitive… If you fall behind, you will never be able to recover. Relaxation is not a regular thing but, rather a luxury that we cannot afford.<br><br/>
            
            Kinky… Life here is twisted beyond repair. For example, why do we have to go for manual evaluations after submitting an assignment? Isn’t that the job of the teaching assistants?<br><br/>
            
            Everlasting… The assignments, exams and quizzes are never-ending. The ending of one is marked by the beginning of another one. Sometimes, many of them are given at the same time. Damn it! it’s endless.<br><br/>
            
            Dictated… Administration has made a bunch of restrictive rules to suffocate the students. But, actually the rules are quite logical and there aren’t any rational arguments to counter them. Still, the students are always whining about them.<br><br/>
            
            Unappreciated… The bar of achievements is set so high that anything that you do will be undermined in a matter of hours.<br><br/>
            
            Perfect… Somehow, everything adds up in the end and students are packaged out into pretty good engineers or researchers.<br><br/>
            
            In short, the life in IIIT Hyderabad can be defined by the phrase formed by the first letters of each of the aforementioned boldfaced words.<br><br/>
            
            P.S. - I’m a pretty optimistic person…</p>
